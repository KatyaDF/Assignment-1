                        <article>
                                <h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</h3>
                                <p>IT is where the world is heading, to be knowledgeable in this field to me is like 	having a superpower. I love helping people and making their lives easier, especially 	when it comes to my grandparents, they always come to me for their technological 	needs, and I love that I can help them and make their lives easier. I love that 	technology can help people who are struggling or are in dire situations. Technology 	enhances your life, you can complete every day tasks quicker which allows you to fit 	more errands into your day, you can access answers to questions at any time of any 	day and I think one of the most beneficial aspects for me is the endless source of 	entertainment, being able to watch television shows, listen to music, play 	games/puzzles and chat with friends. I want to be able to unlock all that I can in the 	IT world to help those around me by optimising their lives as best as I can and to 	achieve the most out of life that I can.</p>

                                <h3>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h3>
                                <p>As far as experience goes, I would say I’m no more equipped in the field of IT than any other 25-year-old who grew up with technology. I know how to use a smart phone and I can use a computer basically. My partner works in IT as a manager at Deloitte, I would say he’s been a bit of an inspiration into my enrolment in this course. He is currently building his own CRM system as a side business, and I would love nothing more than to be able to assist him with that as I know he needs the help.</p>

                                <h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
                                <p>I chose to come to RMIT to learn about IT and see if it was the course for me, RMIT was one of the only universities that offered a 100% online introductory 	course and then I read the course details and I was attracted to the fact that the course was really about the basics and fundamentals of IT which would give me the opportunity to discover if this would be the career for me to go down. I 	also read 	that RMIT were voted number 1 for graduate employment in 2022 which is of 	course appealing.</p>

                                <h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
                                <p>I expect to get a feel for all the areas of IT and learn the basics of software, data, robotics, the web, and security so that I can choose which path I want to go down in 	the area of IT as there are so many roads you can go down. You can essentially link IT with every single career path in one way or another.</p>

                              <h3>Information Technology Cadet</h3>
                              <img src="Job Ad.png" alt="Job Ad"/>


                              <h3>Job Description</h3>
                              <p>This job involves general support of business systems and solving every day IT issues, some key responsibilities include providing IT desktop support, data analysis and testing upgrades to credit union applications. What is appealing about this job for me is the fact it is entry level, it is for someone who is new to IT or who is currently studying. I like that it is very basic and will give you a general feel of the basics of IT and a few different aspects of IT. This would be perfect for me as I am still unsure which path I would want to go down in IT or if I will even like it at all. The company also sound genuine and professional.</p>

                              <h3>Skills and Qualifications Required for this Job </h3>
                              <p>For this job you will need strong problem solving skills and the ability to take initiative and to think quickly on your feet to solve any systems errors, being a bank they rely heavily on computers/IT systems so if something is to go wrong, the customers wouldn't be able to be serviced. You should be familiar with technology, in particular Microsoft Office Suite. You would need an IT degree or at least be working toward one.</p>

                              <h3>Skills and Qualifications I Currently Have</h3>
                              <p>I don't have any qualifications, but I believe I am tech savvy and I have experience working with different softwares incuding Microsoft Office through my current employment doing admin at a dental clinc. I have good customer service skills as I interact with patients every day at work and I have very good attention to detail which would benefit me in this type of job as it sounds like I would also be involved in the business side of things as well as IT.</p>

                              <h3>How I Will Obtain These Skills and Qualifications</h3>
                              <p>I plan on completing this introductory course at RMIT, I haven't decided wether I will go straight into an IT degree or if I will do multiple short online training courses that teach you specific skills until I find the one I enjoy the most. Eg. Introuduction to Programming, Data Analytics for Cyber Security or Database Concepts.</p>

                              <h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h3>
                              <p>If I’m being honest, I sometimes find it hard to evaluate myself and my personality as I feel I’m not necessarily boxed into one category. I find it much easier identifying other people’s personality traits rather than my own. I think sometimes my mood or the type of work I’m doing or even how well I know the people I am interacting with can influence my personality/reactions. I agree with most parts of the results. When at work I do enjoy having my set tasks to complete and being left alone to complete them without disruption. I do get impatient if people are not as quick at completing tasks as I am at work. I am reliable/dependable at work, I very rarely take a sick day and can always be counted on to complete the tasks I have been set. This is something that is regularly acknowledged by my superiors. I’ve been at my workplace for over a year and a half now and it is quite repetitive, but I like it because I know what to expect and I know what to do and do it very fast and rarely with errors. I don’t like change and when processes do change at work it can make me a bit uneasy, so that is something I agree with in my results. I am reluctant to let other people do my job even when I have too much on my plate as I like to prove to my peers that I am capable and sometimes I believe I can do a better job, I can be a bit stubborn in that aspect. When I do teach someone at work to take on parts of my role, I teach them to do it exactly as I do. I can be innovative when I need to be, but quite frankly I prefer other people to create the processes and then I just follow it by the book and complete the task more rapidly than even they can. </p>

                              <h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </h3>
                              <p>According to the results my weaknesses are believing I am the only person who can see a project through reliably and hence not listening to other people’s ideas. I don’t believe this is an accurate representation of myself, but regardless this won’t be the case in this course as I will admit I don’t know anything about IT so I will be relying on listening to my group members.  My strengths according to the results are my responsibility and reliability, if I am doing a group project, I would hate to let my team down, I will fulfil my role to the best of my ability by the project deadline. </p>

                              <h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
                              <p>If we are referring specifically to forming a team for the next assignment in this course I would hope I am in a group with people that understand that although I don’t have much knowledge in IT I will try my best to contribute to the project and I will hopefully have a leader in the group that can assign tasks for me to complete as my contribution to the project. </p>

                  <div class="selectionContent">
                        <article>
                                <h3>Overview</h3>
                                <p>My project idea is an app where you can store your dog's microchip details
                                It would also have a scanning technology where you can scan other dog's microchips, you could use this when you find a lost dog and then their details would come up on your phone and you can return the dog to their owner. This could also be used if you meet someone with a dog and they let you scan their dog's microchip to find out more information about them. I would have this linked to a social networking profile as well so your dog can add other dog's they meet on their walks and keep in contact. This app would also be used to search for your dog's siblings as litters have similar microchip numbers and then the dogs can reunite with their siblings.</p>

                                <h3>Motivation</h3>
                                <p>Dogs have become increasingly popular in the last decade, 62% of people in Australia have a pet, we have almost 4.2 million pet dogs in Australia. This app would be very useful as anyone who has lost a dog, which for most people is like a child know how stressful that situation is. If someone is able to so easily locate where the missing dog has come from it'll be easy for them to be reunited with their owners. I myself have always wondered where my dog's siblings are and wether they'd recognise each other if they were to reunite, I can imagine many other people would wonder the same thing. I would love for my dog to meet his brothers/sisters.</p>

                                <h3>Description</h3>
                                <p> Own personal dog profile - This would list your dog's microchip number, name, address, contact number, likes/dislikes, allergies, medical history etc.
                                Microship scanner - You can scan dog's microchip to read their personal details, wether it is out of interest or you want to add them on your dog's socials or the dog is lost, I would keep in mind to have a feature where you can block your address out to certain people.
                                Social media - Sort of like a dog Facebook where you can upload photos and statuses.
                                Microchip search - You can search microchips from your dog's litters and organise catch ups.
                                Map - I would include a map that shows you the nearest dog park/dog beach/nearest dog event/nearest dog frinedly establishment and it would show you which other dogs are there or how busy the park is (if their owner has chosen to tag their location.)</p>

                                <h3>Tools and Technologies (100) words) - Describe the software, hardware and/or other equipment needed. Include any relevant open source tools as appropriate. </h3>
                                <p></p>

                                <h3>Skills Required (100 words) - List the skills are required for your project, including software that needs to be written, and special hardware (if any). How feasible will it be to find the skills, software and hardware required?</h3>
                                <p></p>

                                <h3>Outcome</h3>
                                <p>If the project were successful the likelihood of a person not getting their dog back after it is lost would be greatly reduced. It would be a great way for dog owners to socialise and make new friends as well as their pets as once you add them on the dog social media, you can organise catch ups and attend events. Dogs bring people together as it is a common interest people have which would be great in a society where people aren't as social in real life anymore. People are always looking for new fun things to do with their pets, this would be a great way for people to find events.</p>
