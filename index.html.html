                                <h2>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</h2>
                                <p>IT is where the world is heading, to be knowledgeable in this field to me is like 	having a superpower. I love helping people and making their lives easier, especially 	when it comes to my grandparents, they always come to me for their technological 	needs, and I love that I can help them and make their lives easier. I love that 	technology can help people who are struggling or are in dire situations. Technology 	enhances your life, you can complete every day tasks quicker which allows you to fit 	more errands into your day, you can access answers to questions at any time of any 	day and I think one of the most beneficial aspects for me is the endless source of 	entertainment, being able to watch television shows, listen to music, play 	games/puzzles and chat with friends. I want to be able to unlock all that I can in the 	IT world to help those around me by optimising their lives as best as I can and to 	achieve the most out of life that I can.</p>

                                <h2>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h2>

                                <p>As far as experience goes, I would say I’m no more equipped in the field of IT 	than any other 25-year-old who grew up with technology. I know how to use a smart 	phone and I can use a computer basically. My partner works in IT as a manager at 	Deloitte, I would say he’s been a bit of an inspiration into my enrolment in this 	course. He is currently building his own CRM system as a side business, and I would 	love nothing more than to be able to assist him with that as I know he needs the 	help.</p>

                                <h2>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h2>

                                <p>I chose to come to RMIT to learn about IT and see if it was the course for me, 	RMIT was one of the only universities that offered a 100% online introductory 	course and then I read the course details and I was attracted to the fact that the 	course was really about the basics and fundamentals of IT which would give me 	the 	opportunity to discover if this would be the career for me to go down. I 	also read 	that RMIT were voted number 1 for graduate employment in 2022 which is of 	course appealing.</p>

                                <h2>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h2>

                                <p>I expect to get a feel for all the areas of IT and learn the basics of software, data, 	robotics, the web, and security so that I can choose which path I want to go down in 	the area of IT as there are so many roads you can go down. You can essentially link 	IT with every single career path in one way or another.</p>
